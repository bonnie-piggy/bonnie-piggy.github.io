        <h2>The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in
a pair of bespoke brogues.
I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
identity.
Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
the web of this period.</h2>
